--Fast InvSqrt:
	http://www.beyond3d.com/articles/fastinvsqrt/

+++ to minimize roundoff error in those array methods below which involve summing all the elements,
the following procedure should have better (the best?) precision:
	--sort the array into ascending order
	--find that pair of adjacent elements whose difference is the smallest
	--remove those 2 nearest neighbors from the array, add them together, and then add the sum back to the array
		(put it in that slot which maintains the ascending order)
	--repeat the above procedure until only 1 element is left; that will be the desired sum of all the original elements
The problems with this algorithm are both increased complexity as well as horrid performance.
At a minimum, if could figure out how to still use java arrays (as opposd to a List of some type),
would still need to make an initial copy of the array that is supplied, as well as do n sorts
(albeit inserting an element into an already sorted array is O(n)).
These costs are why have not yet attempted to do it, but maybe Mathematica does something like it...

For a cheaper to compute, but hopefull high accuracy algorithm compared to the above, what about the Kahan summation algorithm:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensated_summation
?  Actually, my sst method below now incorporates a form of compensated summation, need to test it...

Code below is how I originally implemented gaussianFit.
It operates by fitting a theoretical Gaussian to the observed PDF.
It was abandoned in favor of the simpler and more robust implementation above which operates directly on numbers.
However, I am keeping it around as an example of how to fit a distribution via the empirical PDF.

					To get a balanced approach that includes the theory for frequency and time domain approaches
					the book by Shumway, the latest edition of the Brockwell and Davis text

					For a graduate course I taught at UC Santa Barbara in 1981 I used the first edition of Fuller's book.
					Anderson provides a thorough account of the time domain theory.
					Excellent texts that specialize in the frequency domain approach are Bloomfield's second edition

	* There are a few situations where one should use the unbiased (biased param == false) estimator.
	* The best example is probably the calculation of confidence intervals,

	* In general, however, the biased estimator is more accurate:

		What is the BEST estimator for the population variance given a sampling of the population?
		
		The naive estimator formula is simply
			variance = SST / n
		where SST is the sum of the squares of the differences of each sample from the estimated population mean, and n is the number of samples.  But this estimator is biased.
		
		The usual formula for the unbiased estimator is
			variance = SST / (n - 1)
			
		Now, here is the trickiness: while unbiasedness is nice, what you really want is a low mean squared error (MSE):
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator
		In fact, the OPTIMAL estimator is one with the minimum MSE (MMSE):
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_mean_squared_error
			
		Now, this article, says that the
			SST / n
		estimator has a "lower estimation variability"
		
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbiased_estimator
		where I assume that "lower estimation variability" has the same meaning as "variance of the estimator" in that MSE reference above:
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator
			
		In fact, its smaller estimator variance, combined with its negative bias (due to the larger denominator, which causes it to underestime the true variance), actually causes the simple n formula to have lower MSE than the n - 1 one:
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error.htm
			
		That implies the n estimator is better than the n - 1 one.
		
		But is it the OPTIMAL one--the estimator with MMSE?
		
		Or is that an unknown at present in statistics?
		
		This article
			http://cnx.rice.edu/content/m11267/latest/
		has a seemingly related discussion, but the Example 1 that they give seems to be irrelevant (e.g. you generally do NOT know the variance-sub-n quantity, nor the mean and variance of the theta quantities, so his result in formulas 9 or 10 is practically useless).
	* </pre>
<!--
+++ further questions:

--what about the sd estimator?
Here too, the biased one is better than the unbiased sd estimator
	[the "divide by N" estimator has] uniformly smaller mean squared error than does the unbiased estimator,
	and is the maximum-likelihood estimate when the population is normally distributed.<br/>
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Estimating_population_standard_deviation_from_sample_standard_deviation
but what is the OPTIMAL sd est?
	--Note that for estimating the variance, as opposed to the sd, it looks like th edivide by n + 1 formula is not only lower in MSE than the the divide by n - 1 formula but is even lower in MSE than the divide by n formula
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error#Examples

--given estimators with a negative bias,
is it possible to set things up so that the negative bias cancels out the positive definite estimator variance
and so you get MSE = 0?
	NO: because the bias enters into the MSE via its square, so it is always non-negative term for the MSE
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error

	Note: the wiki reference above also makes the statement:
		The unbiased model with the smallest MSE is generally interpreted as best explaining the variability in the observations.
	WHY do they only consider unbiased estimators?



http://www.wilmott.com/


Stats questions/research ideas:

1) if know the bias of an estimator,
can you simply subtract it to obtain a new (shifted) estimator which is now unbiased
but should have the same variance (and hence lower MSE)?

and what ARE the optimal estimators for the common stats?  or are they not known?
	so far, i just know that the /n is better than /(n - 1), but do not know that it is optimal globally


2) for conf intervals, is it possible that could obtain a narrower interval
if instead of +- the SAME constant from the mean,
you did + of one amount and - of a different amount?

I think that doing +- the same amount is, in fact, optimal for certain assumptions about the probability distribution,
such as that it is symmetric about the mean (e.g. as it is for a Gaussian),
but this will not be true for other asymmetric distributions (e.g. log-normal, chi-square)

Answer: if look at the chi-squared distribution used for conf intervals for sd/var,
it turns out that the standard theory uses asymmetric + and - values from the mean.
Furthermore, at least one person has noted that the standard theory does not give minimum intervals:
	... the resulting ... confidence interval is not the shortest that can be formed using the available data. The tables and appendixes gives solutions for a and b that yield confidence interval of minimum length for the standard deviation.
	http://cnx.org/content/m13496/latest/


3) if you have multiple estimators, can you combine them somehow to, say, get narrower conf intervals?

for mean estimators, we not only have the n vs n - 1 estimators,
but consider a geometric mean estimator that is the nth root of the product of the n samples;
	--what are the properties of this one?
		--it is nonlinear, so it almost certainly is biased...
	--could one play with the root value to obtain a better quality estimator?
	--could it have better robustness characteristics?

there have to be an infinite number of other estimators,
which may mean that it is impossible to work with the entire space of possible estimators

what possibly may work instead is to come up with an algorithm that takes a set of estimators
and generates a new estimator that is some function of the original set but is guaranteed to be a better one;
then you could add that new one back to the set and repeat the process?


4) THIS ARTICLE HAS SOME INTERESTING THOUGHTS, such as what he calls "ANTI-biased" estimators, which he achieves by leaving out samples
	http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath497.htm
Makes me think: is there any way that you could show that you can get a better estimator using more complicated calculations?

What about doing n jacknife estimates (where each variance_i is calculated using some other estimator but with x_i left out) and then using all n of the results somehow to prove bounds on the population variance?
Maybe would need to use nonlinear operations like Maximum(variance_i) and/or Minimum(variance_i)

/*
below is an old implementation for  that I used before I started using the JSci TDistribution class
	
	**
	* Implements the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of Student's t-distribution
	* (i.e. returns that value of x such that the t-distribution's cdf evaluated at x equals probability).
	* <p>
The current implementation uses a table lookup approach.
This is obviously problematic because of limited coverage:
there are many valid values for degreesOfFreedom and/or probability which are not in the table,
which means that this method can only fail in those circumstances.
<!--
+++ fix this with a better algorithm in the future that can handle arbitrary legitimate args
-->
	* <p>
	* Contract: the result is always in the range [-Infinity, Infinity], and is never NaN
	* <p>
	* @throws IllegalArgumentException if degreesOfFreedom <= 0; probability < 0
* @throws IllegalStateException if the table lookup fails for degreesOfFreedom and/or probability;
this does not imply that those args are invalid, just that the table is limited
	*
	public static double tDistributionCdfInverse(int degreesOfFreedom, double probability) throws IllegalArgumentException, IllegalStateException {
		Check.arg().positive(degreesOfFreedom);
		Check.arg().notNegative(probability);

	double max = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
	double min = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
	for (int i = 0; i < dofArray.length; i++) {
		for (int j = 0; j < probabilities.length; j++) {
			double v1 = Math2.tDistributionCdfInverse(dofArray[i], probabilities[j]);

			if (diff > max) max = diff;

		}
	}
	d.p.s("max = " + max);
	d.p.s("min = " + min);

its output was:
